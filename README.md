# Templates-Vector
Created a Vector data structure using templates and cpp
I created this project in order to conclude the OOP course that I took in college and prepare for the next course on data structures.
Furthermore, I was wondering how they invented <strong>vector</strong> class and how they used pointers to develop it. That's why I developed my own 
version of <strong>vector</strong> class with all the important functionalities implemented in it. I called it <strong>Vector</strong> where first letter is capital.
